# Advent of code

Repository of my own solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges, primarily written in Javascript.

Be warned, I'm implementing a lot of these early in the morning (and I am decidely not a morning person); I'm simply aiming to get to the correct answer, code cleanliness, performance, or good use of design patterns aren't being considered at all.
